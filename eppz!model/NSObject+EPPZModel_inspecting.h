 Returns an array with all the available properties for the given @c <EPPZModel> object.
 It traverses up the inheritance chain, but collects properties only from @c <EPPZModel>
 classes (having this, you can avoid collect really basic properties you are not interested
 in, like basic @c NSObject, @c UIKit properties, or accessibility properies for example).
 
 It gets populated once when the class loads, so later updates in class structure (like
 runtime property swizzling) have to be invoked manually using @c -updatePropertyNames.
