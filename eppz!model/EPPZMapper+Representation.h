 @param model
 Model object to be represented.
 
 @param fields
 Either an @c NSArray of fields to be represented, or may pass in an @c NSDictionary with fields,
 and can also passing sub-fields within collections down the line. In the latter case only
 the keys gonna be parsed, the actual values will be dismissed (unless it is a sub-field
 @c NSDictionary).
 
 @param pool
